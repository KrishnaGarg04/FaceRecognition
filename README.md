Face Recognition Using PCA & Eigenfaces
Overview
This project implements Face Recognition using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Eigenfaces. PCA reduces dimensionality while preserving key facial features, enabling efficient recognition and reconstruction.

Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Load, grayscale, and flatten images.
Train-Test Split: Organize data into training & testing sets.
PCA Application: Compute eigenfaces from the covariance matrix.
Feature Extraction: Project images onto top principal components.
Face Reconstruction: Recreate images using eigenfaces.
Key Features
✅ Dimensionality Reduction for efficient processing.
✅ Eigenfaces-based Classification using Euclidean distance.
✅ Image Reconstruction from principal components.
